You think it's another person. You hear a groan behind you and the shadow of a huge man stumbles to his feet and staggers towards the faint light. You realize the glow is a doorway. The man blocks most of the glow as he passes through and then out of sight. You get to your feet but choose to explore the space you are in. The person you first saw gets up and without a backward glance goes out through the door. You see someone else that you hadn't noticed before who similarly struggles to their feet and seeming to be in a daze, they also leave the room without acknowledging you or looking around them at all.
